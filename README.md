## Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for drug discovery. The goal is to leverage the power of GNNs to predict the efficacy and properties of potential drug candidates. See [conference poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NRGLmcSL6tOi51_S_btcTRdc88D3NgN3Eel8vRDg4xM/edit?usp=sharing) for details.
